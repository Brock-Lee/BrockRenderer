# BrockRenderer
This is a software rasterization renderer, developped by Brock.
The main purpose of this project is to simulate the Modern GPU pipeline on CPU.
The latest version includes features such as:
1. Multi-threaded vertex processing.
2. Near plane and backface triangle clipping.
3. Gouraud shading with Blin-Phong lighting.
4. Perspective correct texture mapping.
5. Triangle mesh loaded with Assimp - an excellent open asset import library.
6. Line/Fill switching.
